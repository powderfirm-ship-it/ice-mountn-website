## Implementation Details

### 1. Location Data Expansion
- **Added 20 new neighborhood locations** to `src/data/locations.ts`
- **Added 20 new neighborhood cities** to `src/data/cities.ts`
- Each location includes:
  - Proper slug, name, and neighborhoods
  - Local landmarks and descriptions
  - Meta titles and descriptions
  - Local challenges and benefits
  - Job counts and average ratings
  - Hero images and gallery images
  - Local FAQs

### 2. Static Page Generation
- **Added `generateStaticParams()` function** to `src/app/locations/[city]/page.tsx`
- Ensures all location pages are pre-generated at build time
- Build now generates 40+ location paths (up from 38)

### 3. Redirect Configuration
- **Added redirects in `next.config.js`**:
  - `/locations/nearby-areas` ‚Üí `/locations` (301)
  - `/services/same-day-tv-mounting` ‚Üí `/same-day-tv-mounting` (301)

### 4. Sitemap Hardening
- **Updated `src/app/sitemap.xml/route.ts`**:
  - Removed non-existent `nearby-areas` location
  - Removed non-canonical `same-day-tv-mounting` service combination
  - Sitemap now only includes valid, accessible URLs

### 5. URL Status Check Scripts
- **Created `scripts/check-urls.ts`** for production testing
- **Created `scripts/check-urls-local.ts`** for local testing
- **Added postbuild script** to `package.json` for automated verification
- Scripts verify all 22 URLs return expected status codes

## Technical Specifications

### Location Page Structure
Each new location page includes:
- **Hero section** with city-specific background image
- **Services grid** with all available TV mounting services
- **Local FAQs** addressing city-specific concerns
- **Trust features** highlighting local expertise
- **Gallery** with relevant installation images
- **SEO optimization** with proper meta tags and structured data

### Build Process
- **Static generation** ensures fast loading and SEO benefits
- **Type safety** maintained throughout with TypeScript
- **Performance optimized** with Next.js 15 features

- All redirects work correctly with 301/308 status codes
- Sitemap contains only valid, accessible URLs
- Build process completes successfully with 323 static pages

## Deployment Instructions

### 1. Build and Verify
```bash
npm run build
# This will automatically run the URL check script
```

### 2. Deploy to Production
```bash
npx vercel --prod
```

### 3. Post-Deployment Verification
```bash
# Test a few URLs manually
curl -I https://www.icemountn.com/locations/bel-air
curl -I https://www.icemountn.com/locations/nearby-areas

# Or run the full check against production
npm run check:urls
```

## Maintenance

### Adding New Locations
1. Add location data to `src/data/locations.ts`
2. Add city data to `src/data/cities.ts`
3. Run build to verify static generation
4. Test URL accessibility

### Monitoring
- Use `npm run check:urls` for regular verification
- Monitor SEMrush reports for any new 4xx errors
- Check build logs for any generation issues
