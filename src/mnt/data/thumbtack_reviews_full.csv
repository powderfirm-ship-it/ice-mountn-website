Jeronah S.,5,"Malik was my technician; he showed up on time and with professionalism. Great communication, sent a picture prior to arriving so I could ID him—really good safety. I had three TVs to be unmounted/removed and walls repaired/holes patched plus two large gaming monitors to be unmounted. He finished in under an hour, was clean, and offered the lowest price of the five quotes. I’ll reach out again when it’s time to mount at my new home."
